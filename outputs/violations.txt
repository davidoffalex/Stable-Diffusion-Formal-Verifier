To determine which images, if any, violate the provided LTL formulas, we need to map each image description to the propositional logic within the LTL formulas, and then check for violations. Let's begin by decoding the descriptions to propositions and then evaluate each LTL formula against these decoded descriptions:

### Image Descriptions and Corresponding Propositions:

1. **00032-1069334580.png:**
   - Description: This image features a Maine Coon cat among plants.
   - Propositions: None of `f`, `a`, `j`, `s`, or `b` applies. 

2. **00069-3192913395.png:**
   - Description: The image features a manatee underwater.
   - Propositions: 
     - `b` (The image is taken from under water)

3. **00085-2798801691.png:**
   - Description: A dolphin leaping out of the water.
   - Propositions:
     - `j` (The dolphin is jumping out of the water)
     - `a` (The dolphin is above the water)

### Evaluating Each LTL Formula:

1. **◊f** (Eventually, the dolphin is floating at the surface of the water):
   - 00032: No dolphin mentioned.
   - 00069: No dolphin mentioned.
   - 00085: Dolphin is jumping (`j`), not floating (`f`).

    Images Violating: All images violate `◊f`.

2. **◊(a ∧ j)** (Eventually, the dolphin is above the water and jumping out of the water):
   - 00032: No dolphin mentioned.
   - 00069: No dolphin mentioned.
   - 00085: `a ∧ j` (Both are true).

    Images Violating: None (as 00085 satisfies this condition).

3. **◻¬b** (Globally, the image is not taken from under water):
   - 00032: Does not violate.
   - 00069: `b` is true, hence violates.
   - 00085: Does not violate.

    Images Violating: 00069 violates `◻¬b`.

4. **◻(¬(f ∨ s) → j)** (If the dolphin is not floating or submerged, it must be jumping):
   - 00032: No dolphin mentioned.
   - 00069: No dolphin mentioned.
   - 00085: `j` is true (satisfies condition).

    Images Violating: None.

5. **◻(s → ¬b)** (If the dolphin is submerged, the image is not taken from under water):
   - 00032: No dolphin mentioned.
   - 00069: No dolphin submerged.
   - 00085: Dolphin is jumping, not submerged.

    Images Violating: None.

6. **◻(f ∨ a ∨ s)** (Globally, the dolphin is either floating, above the water, or submerged):
   - 00032: No dolphin mentioned (violates the condition).
   - 00069: No dolphin mentioned (violates the condition).
   - 00085: `a` (Dolphin is above the water).

    Images Violating: 00032 and 00069.

### Summary of Violations:

1. **00032-1069334580.png:**
   - Violated LTL(s): `◊f`, `◻(f ∨ a ∨ s)`

2. **00069-3192913395.png:**
   - Violated LTL(s): `◊f`, `◻¬b`, `◻(f ∨ a ∨ s)`

3. **00085-2798801691.png:**
   - Violated LTL(s): `◊f`
