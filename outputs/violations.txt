To determine which LTLs from the specified list were violated based on the given image descriptions, let's review each LTL and check if there are any discrepancies.

### LTLs to Evaluate

1. **◊f**: "Eventually, the dolphin is floating at the surface of the water."
2. **◊(a ∧ j)**: "Eventually, the dolphin is above the water and jumping."
3. **◻¬b**: "Globally, the image is not taken from underwater."
4. **◻(¬(f ∨ s) → j)**: "Globally, if the dolphin is not floating or submerged, then it must be jumping."
5. **◻(s → ¬b)**: "Globally, if the dolphin is submerged, then the image is not taken from underwater."
6. **◻(f ∨ a ∨ s)**: "Globally, the dolphin is either floating, above the water, or submerged."

### Image Descriptions

1. **00032-1069334580.png**: Describes a Maine Coon cat, no dolphins mentioned.
2. **00069-3192913395.png**: Describes a manatee underwater, no dolphins mentioned.
3. **00085-2798801691.png**: Describes a dolphin leaping out of the water (dolphin is jumping).

### Evaluations

#### ◊f
No image explicitly describes the dolphin floating at the surface of the water.
- **Violated by**: Whole dataset

#### ◊(a ∧ j)
The image **00085-2798801691.png** describes a dolphin jumping out of the water, hence meeting the criteria of the dolphin above the water and jumping.
- **Not violated**

#### ◻¬b
**00069-3192913395.png** clearly describes an underwater scene.
- **Violated by**: 00069-3192913395.png

#### ◻(¬(f ∨ s) → j)
This is a bit complex to assess due to the lack of information in the descriptions about other states (floating or submerged). However, it seems **00085-2798801691.png** implicitly abides by this LTL because the dolphin is jumping and there are no states specified for other images.
- **Not violated**

#### ◻(s → ¬b)
There is no indication in the provided dataset that a dolphin is submerged and an image is taken underwater. Hence, this assessment doesn’t apply directly from the descriptions.
- **Not violated**

#### ◻(f ∨ a ∨ s)
Both **00032-1069334580.png** and **00069-3192913395.png** do not involve dolphins at all while **00085-2798801691.png** does confirm the dolphin is above the water.
- **Violated by**: Whole dataset (images without any mention of dolphins: 00032-1069334580.png, 00069-3192913395.png)

### Summary of Violations
- **◊f**: whole dataset
- **◻¬b**: 00069-3192913395.png
- **◻(f ∨ a ∨ s)**: whole dataset

This summary indicates which Linear Temporal Logic formulas have been violated and by which images or if the issue lies with the entire dataset.
