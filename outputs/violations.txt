To determine which Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas were violated and by which images, I'll analyze each image description in relation to each LTL formula.

### Image Descriptions and Propositions Mapping
1. **00032-1069334580.png**: No mention of dolphins or underwater descriptions.
   - Relevant propositions: None.
   
2. **00069-3192913395.png**: Describes a manatee underwater.
   - Relevant propositions: None (as it's about a dolphin and the image is of a manatee).

3. **00085-2798801691.png**: Dolphin mid-jump above the surface.
   - Relevant propositions:
     - \( a \): The dolphin is above the water.
     - \( j \): The dolphin is jumping out of the water.

### LTL Formulas Analysis
1. **\( ◊f \)**: "Eventually, the dolphin is floating at the surface of the water."
   - Violated. None of the images show a dolphin at the surface of the water.
   - Violating images: whole dataset.

2. **\( ◊(a ∧ j) \)**: "Eventually, the dolphin is above the water and jumping."
   - Satisfied by 00085-2798801691.png
   - No violation detected.

3. **\( ◻¬b \)**: "Globally, the image is not taken from underwater."
   - Violated by 00069-3192913395.png (since it's underwater with a manatee).
   - Violating images: 00069-3192913395.png.

4. **\( ◻(¬(f ∨ s) → j) \)**: "Globally, if the dolphin is neither floating at the surface nor submerged below the water, then the dolphin is jumping."
   - We need to check it in the context of dolphin images:
     - For image 00085-2798801691.png: Dolphin is jumping, so the formula is satisfied.
     - Other images do not feature dolphins or water-related contexts.
   - No broader context violation detected.
   - No violation detected.
   
5. **\( ◻(s → ¬b) \)**: "Globally, if the dolphin is submerged below the water, then the image is not taken from underwater."
   - No image shows a submerged dolphin.
   - No violation detected.

6. **\( ◻(f ∨ a ∨ s) \)**: "Globally, the dolphin is either floating, above the water, or submerged below the water."
   - Image 00085-2798801691.png satisfies it as the dolphin is above water and jumping.
   - Other images do not feature dolphins in water contexts.
   - No broader context violation detected.
   - No violation detected.

Based on the analysis, here is the list of violated LTLs and the corresponding images:

### Violated LTLs:

1. **\( ◊f \)** (Eventually, the dolphin is floating at the surface of the water)
   - Violated by: whole dataset.

2. **\( ◻¬b \)** (Globally, the image is not taken from underwater)
   - Violated by: 00069-3192913395.png.
